Description: UnixBench is the original BYTE UNIX benchmark suite
 The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a basic indicator of the performance
 of a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests are used to test various aspects
 of the system's performance. These test results are then compared to the
 scores from a baseline system to produce an index value, which is generally
 easier to handle than the raw scores. The entire set of index values is then
 combined to make an overall index for the system.
 Some very simple graphics tests are included to measure the 2D and 3D graphics
 performance of the system.
